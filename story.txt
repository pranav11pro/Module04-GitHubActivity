Damien walked into a crowded bar on a rainy Saturday evening. He took off his hood and scanned the area looking for his client. 
He noticed another man sitting alone in the corner of the bar with his head down. He went up to the bar, ordered a drink, and walked over to the man sitting in the corner. 
The mysterious man looked up at him, and as they made eye contact, Damien noticed that the man's eyes were glowing red. 

"Sir! Are you ok? Your eyes are glowing red!" said by Damien. The mysterious man's eyes were too strange. Damien worried that the man had some eye diseases.
However, the man didn't give Damien any response but still kept his red eyes on Damien's face. At this moment, Damien felt something dangerous was following him.
Just like the leopard followed the prey's movement.
